1,The program will randomly pick two directions every five minutes. After picking the directions,the times of all the
routes from one direction to another will be calculated and store in the file regular.csv. The fastest route (time) will
be saved in the file best.csv.
2, Every time there would be 2 sets of geocoordinates for each direction (from one direction to another) being input 
to the program and the result of the time between them will be generated and stored in regular.csv.
For example, if we have two direction (From) East and (to) West. And a,b are the two locations for East direction and
c,d are the two locations for West direction. Then, in the regular.csv, we have


iter numb	c	d
	a	30	60
	b	40	70

Please notice that all the numbers have second as unit.
3, The log_file_saved is the file created to store all the intermediate value the program got for debugging purpose.
